To the moon we ride or we die!
The banks are hoping to use the futures market to suppress the price of Bitcoin like they've done with the gold and silver markets.

They've underestimated the need for sound money that their corrupt business practices have created.
If they try to short the Bitcoin market, the wave upon wave of Bitcoin customers desperate for value, will sweep past any positions the banks are taking.

They will of course try to throw unlimited amounts of "bailout" money provided by their bought politicians, but it won't do any good.

There is simple no alternative, except Bitcoin, to store and transmit value without corrupt third party intermediaries gouging fees and cancelling transactions.

The banks themselves created the vacuum that Bitcoin fills, they have only themselves to blame.

Remember why Bitcoin was created.
Remember the multimillion dollar executive bonuses using "bailout" money while millions of newly homeless people wandered the streets with eyes like broken Christmas lights.

Remember 2008!

HODL for the Win.


============================================

If the futures traders try to short the market by dumping to suppress, the waiting tidal wave of hodlers who thought they'd missed out will rush in like a tsunami to grab the bargain price which will send it rocketing right back up again. They don't do sophistication, they just want in, and believe me, they ARE waiting, by the million.

I see many people are upset about Coinbase and their insane transfer fees so I thought I would make a simple instruction about how to transfer Bitcoin outta Coinbase for free. Lets get to it!
Go to GDAX.com and log in with your Coinbase account. GDAX is owned by Coinbase, and it’s their platform for more technical people.
After you logged in, verify your account if necessary.
Press the “deposit” button and then deposit your Bitcoin from your Coinbase wallet. It’s free and takes only seconds.
Press the “withdraw” button, then open the “BTC address” tab and put the address you wish to send your bitcoins to in there.

What's the best way to send bitcoins from a paper wallet?

I believe it's called "sweeping." Make sure to sweep it into a wallet in your possession. I don't think paper wallets can be partially spent.
Tangentially, if you had BTC in a paper wallet, at the time of the BCH, BTG, or BCD forks (or others in the future), you may wish to keep that paper wallet around after sweeping if you want to access your forked coin.

This is if you wish to move your coins off coinbase. And into another wallet where you own the private keys. For things like obtaining coin forks such as bch or btg

You can avoid even more fees on gdax if you are selling crypto for u.s. dollars. Do NOT make a market sell order. Set a limit order and check the box to ensure that you are a market maker (as opposed to taker) and you will avoid the sale fees.
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
So you have to remember that the bitcoins are never not "online" because they're all part of the blockchain. What it means is that the private keys with which you access the coins are stored on digital media that is not connected to the internet.

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Please note that imported addresses are not backed up by the wallet recovery phrase. We strongly recommend you sweep funds from imported addresses.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
When you initiate a transaction, all previous transactions to or from that address are scanned and a balance is calculated. If your transaction exceeds this available balance, it will be rejected by the network and will not be included in a block.
